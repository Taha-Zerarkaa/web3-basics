Ethereum gas refers to the unit of measurement used to calculate the computational effort required to execute a transaction or contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Every operation performed on the Ethereum network requires a certain amount of computational resources, which are measured in gas. Gas is purchased using ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, and is used to pay the miners who validate and process transactions on the network.

Gwei, short for gigawei, is a smaller denomination of ether that is commonly used to express gas prices. One gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH, or 10^-9 ETH. Gas prices are typically quoted in gwei per unit of gas, with the price per transaction or contract execution depending on the amount of gas required for that operation and the current market rate for gwei. The higher the gas price, the faster a transaction will be processed by the network, since miners are incentivized to prioritize transactions with higher fees.
