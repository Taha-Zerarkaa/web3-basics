chainId is a property of the Ethereum blockchain that represents the unique identifier of a specific blockchain network. In the context of Ethereum, chainId is a 256-bit unsigned integer that is used to distinguish between different Ethereum networks, such as the mainnet, testnets, and private networks.

Each Ethereum network has a unique chainId, which is used by clients to verify the network they are connected to and to ensure that transactions are only broadcasted to the intended network. When a transaction is signed, the chainId is included in the transaction data to ensure that the transaction can only be executed on the correct network.

In addition, chainId is used by developers to deploy smart contracts and to interact with the Ethereum network programmatically. The chainId value can be retrieved using Ethereum client software or by querying a blockchain explorer.
