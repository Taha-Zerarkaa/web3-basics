In the Ethereum network, data is stored on the blockchain, which is a decentralized and distributed database that is maintained by all the nodes in the network. The blockchain is essentially a ledger that records all the transactions and smart contracts executed on the Ethereum network.

Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions and a reference to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks that is maintained by all the nodes in the network. When a new transaction or smart contract is executed on the network, it is verified by the nodes and added to the blockchain. Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the immutability and security of the data.

In addition to transaction data, the Ethereum network also supports the storage of smart contract code and state. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can be used to automate and enforce agreements between parties. The state of a smart contract refers to the current values of its variables and data storage, which are also recorded on the blockchain.

Overall, the Ethereum network provides a secure and transparent way to store data, transactions, and smart contracts, with all the nodes in the network maintaining a copy of the blockchain. This ensures the integrity and immutability of the data, and prevents any single entity from controlling or manipulating the data on the network.
