In web3, getNamedAccounts() is a function that is used to retrieve the Ethereum addresses of named accounts from the connected Ethereum node. Named accounts are those that have been defined in a configuration file or by a framework like Hardhat or Truffle.
Once you have defined your named accounts in your configuration file, you can use getNamedAccounts() in your scripts to retrieve their addresses. Note that the getNamedAccounts() function is only available when running scripts using the Hardhat or Truffle CLI. If you are running your script in some other context, you will need to manually retrieve the addresses of your named accounts using web3.eth.getAccounts() and the indices specified in your configuration file.
