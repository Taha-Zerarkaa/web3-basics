In Web3, an aggregator is a decentralized service or platform that gathers and aggregates data from multiple sources on the blockchain, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and liquidity pools, and presents it in a unified format to users.

Aggregators play a key role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, as they provide users with a comprehensive overview of the best prices and liquidity across multiple DEXs, enabling them to make informed decisions when trading cryptocurrencies.

Aggregators typically use smart contracts to execute trades on behalf of users, and may charge a fee for their services. Some popular aggregators in the Web3 space include 1inch, Matcha, and Paraswap.
